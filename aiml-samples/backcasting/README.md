### Generating Time-Series Data (Backcasting) for a Newly Listed Stock Using Gaussian Models and GMM

##### Why Do We Need to Backfill Stock Data?
 
Backcasting is about estimating past values when historical data is incomplete or missing (e.g., filling in stock prices for previous months before a stock was listed). For example, backfilling stock data is essential in multiple financial and analytical use cases, including:
 
- Portfolio Analysis and Risk Management: Computing historical performance metrics like Sharpe Ratio or Value at Risk (VaR) requires complete stock histories.
 
- Factor Investing and Quant Strategies: Many investment models rely on factor-based signals (momentum, volatility, earnings growth), requiring historical data.
 
- Index and ETF Inclusion Analysis: Before adding a stock to an index, analysts often model how it would have historically performed.
 
 

#### Approaches

Let's explore two approaches to backfilling stock data:
 
1. With Limited Historical Data
 
- Regression-based Backcasting
 
- Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
 
- GMM + Conditional Variate Approach
 
 
2. Without Any Historical Data
 
- Using a Gaussian Distribution to model synthetic stock trends
