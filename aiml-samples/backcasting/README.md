### Generating Time-Series Data (Backcasting) for a newly listed stock using Gaussian Models and GMM

When a stock is newly listed, it lacks sufficient historical data, making it challenging for analysts, traders, and machine learning models to extract meaningful trends. But what if we could generate synthetic past stock data using statistical models? In this article, we will explore **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), regression, and Gaussian distributions** (using PySpark on the Azure Databricks platform). Lastly, we will understand the limitations of such an approach and explore mitigation measures. Letâ€™s dive in!

#### Why do we need to backfill stock data?
 
Backcasting is about estimating past values when historical data is incomplete or missing (e.g., filling in stock prices for previous months before a stock was listed). 

Backfilling stock data is essential in multiple financial and analytical use cases, including (but not limited to):
 
- Portfolio Analysis and Risk Management: Computing historical performance metrics like Sharpe Ratio or Value at Risk (VaR) requires complete stock histories.
 
- Factor Investing and Quant Strategies: Many investment models rely on factor-based signals (momentum, volatility, earnings growth), requiring historical data.
 
- Index and ETF Inclusion Analysis: Before adding a stock to an index, analysts often model how it would have historically performed.

Use Cases for Backcasting
 
- Completing missing historical data for newly listed stocks. 
- Estimating pre-launch trends for algorithmic trading models. 
- Filling gaps in datasets due to missing or corrupted records (data quality issues).

#### Approaches

Let's explore and compare below approaches to backfilling stock data, where assuming limited historical data are available:
 
- Regression-based backcasting: Using linear regression (you may use ARIMA as well)
- Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM): GMM models stock prices as a mixture of multiple Gaussian distributions, capturing complex price behaviors.
- GMM + Conditional Variate Approach: Adding market constraints like volatility thresholds and trend continuity.
- Enhancing further with sentiment analysis: When using Generative AI (using alternative datasets) or NLP-based sentiment analysis on stock news (e.g., using OpenBB SDK), synthetic price trends can align price action with sentiment scores for better predictions.
