# Power BI P SKU Estate - Automated Discovery

## Introduction

If youâ€™re in the process of migrating your Power BI P SKU to Fabric SKU, or even just thinking about it, you know how crucial it is to have a detailed understanding of your current environment. 

The seamless migration from **Power BI P SKU** to **Fabric F SKU** requires meticulous planning and comprehensive discovery. This post will introduce a PowerShell script that automates the discovery of the current Power BI P SKU estate, providing valuable insights for the migration process. This script aims to automate the discovery of your Power BI SKU estate and could be a great starting point for your discovery and assessment journey. You can, of course, tweak it to gather even more insights based on your specific needs!

## Pre-requisites

Before we dive into the script, ensure that you have the following pre-requisites:

**NOTE**: Follow [security best practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/security/) and edit/modify the scripts as per your organization needs and standards. These are sample scripts, only for reference.

1. PowerShell 5.1 or higher
2. MicrosoftPowerBIMgmt module installed. If not, you can install it using the command `Install-Module -Name MicrosoftPowerBIMgmt`
3. Admin / Service Principal credentials for Power BI service with appropriate permissions at workspace level.

## Powershell Script

Below are few options for automated discovery. It is recommended to test the scripts in lower environment before using in Prod, for expected results.

- Install required modules if not already installed and verify permissions

- Review API permissions from product documentation

- Verify scope, for example:
  - Service Principal: Tenant.ReadWrite.All, Capacity.Read.All, Workspace.Read.All, Items.Read.All
  - Admin user: Fabric Admin, Capacity Admin, Workspace Admin

## Considerations

Install required modules if not already installed and verify permissions 

These script begins by connecting to the Power BI service using admin credentials or service principal. Refer to above table and scripts for details.

The scripts retrieve below details for the workspaces:
- WorkspaceId,
- WorkspaceName,
- Type,
- State,
- IsReadOnly,
- IsOrphaned,
- IsOnDedicatedCapacity,
- CapacityId,
- Owners,
- DashboardsCount,
- ReportsCount,
- DatasetsCount,
- DataflowsCount,
- FabricItemsCount,
- Additional metadata in case of Detailed Metadata Scan

For example: The script exports the workspace details to a CSV file. This automated process significantly reduces the time and effort required for manual discovery, providing a comprehensive overview of the current Power BI P SKU estate.

## Summary

Performing a comprehensive discovery of the current Power BI P SKU estate is a crucial step in planning for the migration to Fabric F SKU. This PowerShell script provides an automated solution for this task, offering valuable insights that can guide the migration process. By leveraging this script, organizations can ensure a smooth and efficient transition, ultimately enhancing their data management and visualization capabilities.

## Migration

For migration there are few options:
1. [Recommended] Bulk migration from Admin Portal (Workspaces>Reassign): https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/admin/portal-workspaces#moving-data-around 
2. Bulk migration using PowerShell script for a given/specific list of workspaces:
    - [Migration Script - for specific list of workspaces](../P2F-SKU-migration/migration/MigrationWorkspacesTranches.ps1)
    - Input: Workspaces Id list in a CSV file and targetCapacity ID

3. Sometimes, you may need to bulk assign admin to the worksapces to be migrated. You may use below script:
   - [BulkAssignAdmin](../P2F-SKU-migration/migration/BulkAssignAdmin.ps1)
   - Input: Workspaces Id list in a CSV file and admin emailAddress = "powerbiadmin@test.com"
